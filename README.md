# doenermann-bot
A Reposetory with the Dönermann bot used in a private server of mine. It's using the discord.py libary. It can be forked and further used without any restrictions. 

Now it can:
- 
- Copy Message of a Channel in a file
- Show with a command how many were copied
- a normal ping(/döner) command
- a /stop command which will stop the bot, only the owner(discord-id) of the bot can dot that
